# 04-JS-Functions

In this course we'll continue to build your JavaScript skills by learning another fundamental building block in JavaScript: **[functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)**. Functions are at the heart of how JavaScript (or any programming language) works. At its simplest, a function is a set of instructions that you want to run over and over again.

functions let you group a series of statements or instructions to perform a specific task by a program.

**Declare a function** with

**[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)** gotoCoffeeShop() {

// block of code

}

the program activates the function by calling the function

```jsx
gotoCoffeeShop()
```

the parenthesis are important - they call the function and activate its programming.

functions let you consolidate and efficiently have a short command to call your function and execute it again and again.
